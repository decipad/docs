# Introduction to the Deci Language

The model blocks allow you to enter and analyse data in a easy and intuitive way. This is made possible via the **Deci language**. The language is how you interact with Deci inside the model blocks.

To get started with the language, go over the pages below to learn about some fundamental concepts:

{% page-ref page="operators.md" %}

{% page-ref page="basic-data-types.md" %}

{% page-ref page="basic-operations.md" %}

When you feel comfortable with those, you can move on to more complex operations:

{% page-ref page="columns-and-tables.md" %}

{% page-ref page="use-cases/" %}
