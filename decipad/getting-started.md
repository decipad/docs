# Getting Started

After signing in, you'll arrive at your first **workspace**. This is the place where your pads live. You can create as many workspaces as you want. To get started, add a **new notebook** to your workspace.

In Deci, narrative and data coexist peacefully. To create some text, simply begin typing. When you select a word or sentence, a **tooltip** with text editing options shows up. Alternatively, you can use [**markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to format your text.

Typing / let's you access the **slash commands**. These allow you to create a model block, a quote or select different headings. The pad also has a "add model block" button, which allows you to create a model block directly.
