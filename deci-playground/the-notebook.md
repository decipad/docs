# The Notebook

In Deci, narrative and data coexist peacefully. To create some text, simply begin typing. When you select a word or sentence, a tooltip with **text editing** options shows up. Alternatively, you can use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to format your text.

Typing `/` let's you access the **slash commands**. These allow you to create a model block, a quote or select different headings. The notebook also has a "**add model block**" button, which allows you to create a model block directly.
