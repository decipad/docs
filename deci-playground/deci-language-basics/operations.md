# Operations

Here's a short showcase of some of the things you can do in Deci.

You can perform arithmetic calculations.

```text
2+2

4
```

If you perform more than one operation, the result section will show the outcome of the last one.

```text
2+2
6+3

9
```

When using the `+`, `-`, `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` and `**` signs, white spaces between values and operators are ignored, so that all of the following operations deliver the same result:

```text
2 + 2
2+2
2 +2

4
```

However, calculations with the operators `/` and `*` require white spaces.

```text
2 / 1

2
```

You can use percentages.

```text
15 * 20%

3
```

You can insert dates.

```text
date (2020-10-22)

Oct 22nd 2020
```

You can define variables and use them in operations. Variable names should not contain any symbols or word operators like `through`,`by` and `date`.

```text
nameofvariable=2
nameofvariable+3

5
```

```text
Salary = 2000
Rent = 500
FoodAndStuff = 400
Savings = Salary - Rent - FoodAndStuff

1100
```

You can create true or false statements.

```text
 2 > 1

True
```
